============

A [piepan](https://github.com/layeh/piepan) script to provide useful and fun features for your Mumble server.

Installation
------------

Build a copy of [piepan](https://github.com/layeh/piepan) for yourself.
Install the required command line tools:

```sudo apt-get install youtube-dl libav-tools normalize-audio```

Usage
-----

Run like you would any other piepan bot:

```piepan -username Botman -insecure=true -certificate botman.pem piepan.conf```

Note that you can specify `--channel` to make the bot join a specific channel.

Type `!help` in the chat for a list of commands. You can whisper them to the bot as well,
but be sure to send regular text and not HTML.
